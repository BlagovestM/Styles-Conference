                <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>
                <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t
                    end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and
                    the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design
                    to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
                    embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>
                <p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get*
                    design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have
                    that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture.
                    Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself
                    anywhere else.</p>
                <h5>About Aaron</h5>
                <p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a foodie, and
                    a master of BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and presentations on the conversation
                    surrounding design over at <a href="http://www.discussingdesign.com/">discussingdesign.com</a>

                <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
                <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written
                    narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together.
                    To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention,
                    emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a
                    well-told story.</p>
                <p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the
                    technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as
                    cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we
                    might look to them for inspiration.</p>
                <h5>About Adam</h5>
                <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication,
                    creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+
                    years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science,
                    film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He
                    believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story;
                    uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design
                    at <a href="http://adamconnor.com/">adamconnor.com</a> and <a

                <h5>(You Should Be) Testing Your JavaScript</h5>
                <p>JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS,
                    Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This
                    talk will share tips on how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to
                    remove buggy code through testing.</p>

                <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>
                <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little
                    better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic
                    interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it
                    increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live
                    rapid prototyping.</p>
                <p>Bermon is the organizer of various community groups for user experience designers and
                    front-end developers, and the organizer of Blend Conference, a three-day, multi-track event
                    for user experience strategists, designers and developers. He also leads the user experience
                    team for Cardinal Solutions’ Charlotte office, where he consults with large enterprise
                    clients on interesting problems across user experience, design and front-end development.
